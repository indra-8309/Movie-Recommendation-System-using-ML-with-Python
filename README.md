# Movie Recommendation System using ML with Python
# numpy
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

# pandas
Pandas is a Python library that is used for faster data analysis, data cleaning and data pre-processing. Pandas is built on top of numpy. So, numpy gets some superpower with pandas. You might have heard about data-frames, which is a common term in machine learning.

# difflib
This module provides classes and functions for comparing sequences. It can be used for example, for comparing files, and can produce information about file differences in various formats, including HTML and context and unified diffs. For comparing directories and files, see also, the filecmp module.

# sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer+
Transform a count matrix to a normalized tf or tf-idf representation.
Tf means term-frequency while tf-idf means term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme in information retrieval, that has also found good use in document classification.
# sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
Compute cosine similarity between samples in X and Y.
Cosine similarity, or the cosine kernel, computes similarity as the normalized dot product of X and Y:
Cos(X, Y) = X . Y / (||X||*||Y||)
